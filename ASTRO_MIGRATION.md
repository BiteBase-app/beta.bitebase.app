# BiteBase Migration to Astro

This document provides information about the migration of the BiteBase project from React to Astro.

## Overview

The BiteBase project has been migrated from a React-based application to an Astro-based application. Astro is a modern web framework that allows you to build faster websites with less client-side JavaScript.

## Migration Steps

The migration involved the following steps:

1. **Copy Components**: All React components were copied from the original project to the Astro project.
2. **Update Dependencies**: The package.json file was updated to include all necessary dependencies.
3. **Create Astro Pages**: Astro pages were created for all sections of the application.
4. **Migrate Backend Code**: Backend code was migrated to the Astro project.
5. **Migrate Cloudflare Workers**: Cloudflare workers were migrated to the Astro project.
